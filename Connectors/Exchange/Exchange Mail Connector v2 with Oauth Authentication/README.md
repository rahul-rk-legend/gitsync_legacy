# Exchange Mail Connector v2 with Oauth Authentication
Connector can be used to monitor specific mailboxes on Office 365 mail servers that require Oauth authentication. Get Authorization and Generate Token actions can be used to obtain refresh token that should be set in the connector. Note: Make sure to configure the integration first for the Oauth authentication.

|Environment Field Name|Describes the name of the field where the environment name is stored. If the environment field isn't found, the environment is the default environment.|False||
|Environment Regex Pattern|A regex pattern to run on the value found in the "Environment Field Name" field. Default is .* to catch all and return value unchanged.
